Great! I'd love to help you learn Python. Let's start by understanding your current level of programming knowledge. Here are a few questions to help me tailor the lessons to your needs:

Have you programmed before? If so, what languages have you used?
Do you know any basic programming concepts (like variables, loops, or functions)?
Whatâ€™s your goal with learning Python? (e.g., data analysis, web development, automation, general programming skills, etc.)
Once I know more, we can dive in at the right level!
